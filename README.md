# Chargepoint-Demand-Management
### Author: Sami Waheed
### Date: September 2018

## Description:
This program accesses Chargepoint's API for Demand Management calls. This is only a class definition that contains helpful functions to proceed with controlling the power sent to Chargepoint's electric vehicle charging stations. I used this to conduct smart charging for a group of charging station at a site. For security purposes I have not included the algorithm or any techniques utilized, so any implementations will need to be written according to the user's needs.
